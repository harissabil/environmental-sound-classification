# Environmental Sound Classification

This repository contains code to build an environmental sound classification model trained on a subset of the [ESC-50 dataset](https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50). The model classifies audio recordings into 15 distinct classes (e.g., siren, car horn, chainsaw, etc.) and includes a pipeline from data preprocessing and CNN training to converting the trained model into a mobile-friendly TFLite format.
